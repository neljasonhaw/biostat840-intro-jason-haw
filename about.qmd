Hi there - I’m Jason Haw, originally from the Philippines, passionate about public health, math, and cooking!

I’m currently a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) candidate in Epidemiology, concurrently a Master of Health Science (MHS) student in Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Heath. I have a Master of Science (MS) degree in Global Health from Georgetown University.

I have been working as a public health researcher and educator since 2014. My research interests and professional experience include social epidemiology, health systems and policy research, and global health.
