    "text": "What is the level of agreement of the two definitions of pre-term birth, i.e. weight at birth < 2,500 grams and weeks of gestation at birth <37 weeks?\n\n\n\nResearchers who may be deciding to choose only one measure over the other to measure preterm birth when there are not enough study resources to do both\nWeeks of gestation is much easier to measure as no other equipment is required unlike birth weight, but may be prone to recall bias if no medical records are available to check. Measuring birth weight is more objective as a scale can be used, but this scale may require more resources, such as procuring the scales across study sites and training research staff follow a standard protocol.\n\n\n\nWe used the publicly available data set from Micalowicz et al (2006) published in the New England Journal of Medicine (Michalowicz et al. 2006), which was a multi-center randomized trial that examined whether timing of periodontal disease treatment (treatment: prior to 21 weeks gestation, control: after delivery) affects the likelihood of pre-term birth, defined as less than 37 weeks gestational age.\nThis is a longitudinal data set of 823 women who were 13-16 weeks gestational age at randomization, followed by five monthly visits. There are 171 variables corresponding to the exposure, outcome, and covariates collected throughout the entire study period.\nThe data set is currently set up in wide format, meaning each row represents one study participant, and the covariates and outcome data collected at follow-up visits are set up as separate columns. Full details on the data set, as well as the complete data dictionary are available here.\nThe data set is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) as part of the medicaldata package, stored as the opt data frame once the package is loaded in library. The variables of interest are:\n\nPID: Patient unique identifier (ID)\nGA.at.outcome: Gestational age in days\nBirthweight: Birth weight in grams\nBirth.outcome: Outcome of pregnancy with four levels\n\nElective abortion\nLive birth\nLost of FU (follow-up)\nNon-live birth (i.e., stillbirth or spontaneous abortion)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe factor values have lagging spaces in the end, so we need to add an additional data processing step using the str_trim function from the stringr package (part of tidyverse) and replace the affected columns using mutate.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe examined a simple relationship between two continuous variables: gestational age at the end of pregnancy (in days) and birth weight at time of delivery (in grams). We expect that generally, there is a positive association between gestational age and birth weight as these are two related measures for pre-term birth (Oken et al. 2003).\nPre-term births are sometimes defined by gestational age (a typical cutoff is 37 weeks), or by weight (a typical cutoff is 2500 grams).\n\n\nThe positive percent agreement is:\n\\[\\frac{A}{A+B+C}\\]\nThe Kappa statistic is:\n\\[\\frac{P(\\mathrm{observed}) - P(\\mathrm{expected})}{1 - P(\\mathrm{expected})}\\]\nwhere \\(P(\\mathrm{observed}) = \\frac{A+D}{A+B+C+D}\\), \\(P(\\mathrm{expected}) = \\frac{(A+C)(A+B) + (B+D)(C+D)}{(A+B+C+D)^2}\\)\nGiven the following 2 x 2 table:\n\ntable <- data.frame(c(\"A\", \"B\"), c(\"C\", \"D\"))\nrownames(table) <- c(\"< 2,500 g\", \">= 2,500 g\")\ncolnames(table) <- c(\"< 37 weeks\", \">= 37 weeks\")\n\nknitr::kable(table, type = \"html\") |>\n  kableExtra::add_header_above(c(\"Birthweight\", \"Gestational age\" = 2))\n\n\n\n \n\nBirthweight\nGestational age\n\n  \n      \n    < 37 weeks \n    >= 37 weeks \n  \n \n\n  \n    < 2,500 g \n    A \n    C \n  \n  \n    >= 2,500 g \n    B \n    D \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nWe want to examine, visually, the level of agreement between these two definitions. We also want to calculate some agreement statistics, such as positive percent agreement and kappa statistic (Xia 2020). The formula for both statistics are found on the side.\nInterpreting the kappa statistic, we use the following guide:"
